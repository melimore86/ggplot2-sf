# Beautiful maps in a beautiful world

Maps are used in a variety of fields to express data in an appealing
and interpretive way. Data can be expressed into simplified complex
patterns, and this data interpretation is generally lost if the data
is only seen through a spread sheet. Maps can add vital context by
incorporating many variables into and easy to read and relatable
context. Maps are also very important in the information world because
they can quickly allow the public to gain better insight so that they
can stay informed. It's critical to have maps be effective, which
means creating maps that can be understood by a given audience. Maps
that need to be understood by children would very different from maps
intended to be shown to geographers. 

Knowing what elements are required to enhance your data is key into
making effective maps.  Basic elements of a map that should be
considered are polygon, points, lines, and text. With that in mind,
one need to think about what is required in the map to really make an
impact on the intended audience. Layout and formatting are the second
critical aspect to enhance data visually. The arrangement of these map
elements and how they will be drawn can be adjusted to make a maximum
impact. Polygons, on a map, are closed shapes such as country
borders. Lines are considered to be linear shapes that are not filled
with any aspect, such as highways, streams, or roads. Finally, points
are used to specify specific positions, such as city or landmark
locations.


# A solution using R and its ecosystem of packages

Current solutions for creating maps usually involves GIS software such
as ArcGIS, QGIS, eSpatial, etc., which allow to visually prepare a
map, in the same approach as one would prepare a poster or a document
layout. On the other hand, [R](https://www.r-project.org/), a free and
open-source software development environment (IDE) that is used for
computing statistical data and graphic in a programmable language, has
developed advanced spatial capabilities over the years, and can now be
used to draw maps programmatically. 

The reason for using R is because it is a powerful and flexible
tool. R can be used from calculating data sets to creating graphs and
maps with the same data set. R is also free, which makes it very
easily accessible to anyone. Some other advantages of using R is that
it has an interactive language, data structures, graphics
availability, a developed community, repairing/replacing missing data,
and the advantage of adding more functionalities through an entire
ecosystem of packages. R is a scriptable language that allows the user
to write out a code in which it will execute the command specified.

Using R to create maps can be very powerful. Elements of a map can be
added or removed with ease â€” R code can be tweaked to make major
enhancements with a stroke of a key.. It is also easy to reproduce the
same maps for different data sets. It is important to be able to
script the elements of a map so that it can be re-used and interpreted
by any user. In essence, comparing typical GIS software and R for
drawing maps is similar to comparing word processing software
(e.g. Microsoft Office or LibreOffice) and a programmatic typesetting
system such as LaTeX, in that typical GIS software implement a WYSIWIG
approach ("what you see is what you get"), while R implements a
WYSIWYM approach ("what you see is what you mean").

The package `ggplot2` implements the grammar of graphics in R, as a
way to create code that make sense to the user: The grammar of
graphics is a term used to breaks up graphs into semantic components,
such as geometries and layers. Practically speaking, it allows (and
forces!) the user to focus on graph elements at a higher level of
abstraction, and how the data must be structured to achieve the
expected outcome.

While `ggplot2` is becoming the *de facto* standard for R graphs, it
does not handle spatial data specifically.  The current standard for
spatial objects in R is defined as `Spatial` classes in the package
`sp`, but a new standard following the "simple feature" standard has
been proposed with the package `sf`.  Recently, the package `ggplot2`
has allowed the use of simple features from the package `sf` as layers
in a graph. The combination of `ggplot2` and `sf` therefore enables to
programmatically create maps, using the grammar of graphics, just as
informative or visually appealing as traditional GIS software.


# General concepts illustrated with the World Map

All packages, unless specified otherwise, are available from CRAN, the
Comprehensive R Archive Network, which is the primary repository of R
packages, and can be installed with:

```{r pkg-generic, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("my_package")
```

However, support of `sf` objects in `ggplot2` is only available in the
development version of the package, which can be installed with:

```{r pkg-ggplot2-sf}
library("devtools")
install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
```

We start by loading the basic packages necessary for all maps,
i.e. `ggplot2` and `sf`. We also suggest to use the classic
dark-on-light theme for `ggplot2` (`theme_bw`), which is more
appropriate for maps:

```{r pkg-basic}
library("ggplot2")
theme_set(theme_bw())
library("sf")
```


## Data and basic plot (`ggplot` and `geom_sf`)

First let us start with creating a base map of the world using
`ggplot2`. This base map will then be extended with different map
elements, as well as zoomed in to an area of interest. The package
`rworldmap` provides a map of countries of the entire world; a map
with higher resolution is available in the package `rworldxtra`.  We
use the function `getMap` to extract the world map (the resolution can
be set to `"low"`, if preferred):

```{r pkg-rworldmap}
library("rworldmap")
library("rworldxtra")
world <- getMap(resolution = "high")
class(world)
```

The world map is available as a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`; we thus
convert it to a simple feature using `st_as_sf` (from package `sf`):

```{r world-sf}
world <- st_as_sf(world)
class(world)
```

We can check that the map was properly retrieved and converted into an
`sf` object, and plot it:

```{r world-plot}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf()
```

This call nicely introduces the structure of a `ggplot` call: The
first part `ggplot(data = world)` initiates the `ggplot` graph, and
indicates that the main data is stored in the `world` object. The line
ends up with a `+` sign, which indicates that the call is not complete
yet, and each subsequent line correspond to another layer or scale. In
this case, we use the `geom_sf` function, which simply adds a geometry
stored in a `sf` object. By default, all geometry functions use the
main data set up in `ggplot()`, but we will see later how to provide
additional data.

Note that layers are added one at a time in a `ggplot` call, so the
order of each layer is very important. All data will have to be in an
`sf` format to be used by `ggplot2`; data in other formats
(e.g. classes from `sp`) will be manually converted to `sf` if
necessary.


## Title, subtitle, and axis labels (`ggtitle`, `xlab`, `ylab`)

A title and a subtitle can be added to the map using the command
`ggtitle`, passing any valid character string (e.g. with quotation
marks) as arguments. Axis names are absent by default on a map, but
can be changed to something more suitable (e.g. "Longitude" and
"Latitude"), depending on the map:
   
```{r world-titles}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf() +
    xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") +
    ggtitle("World map", subtitle = paste0("(", length(unique(world$NAME)), " countries)"))
```


## Map color (`geom_sf`)

In a way, `sf` geometries are no different than regular geometries,
and can be displayed with the same level of control on their
attributes. Here is an example with the polygons of the countries
filled with a green color (argument `fill`), using black for the
outline of the countries (argument `color`):

```{r world-colors}
ggplot(data = world) + 
    geom_sf(color = "black", fill = "lightgreen")
```

The package `ggplot2` allows the use of more complex color schemes,
such as a gradient on one variable of the data. Here is another
example that shows the population of each country. Note that the color
gradient is based on a colorblind friendly palette from the `viridis`
package (`option = "C"` corresponds to the `plasma` palette), using
the square root of the population (which is stored in the variable
`POP_EST` of the `world` object):

```{r world-colors-pop}
library("viridis")
ggplot(data = world, aes(fill = POP_EST)) +
    geom_sf() +
    scale_fill_viridis(option = "C", trans = "sqrt")
```

Note that, in this case, as `world` is declared as the main dataset
directly in the initial `ggplot()` call, the color gradient can also
be set at the same place, in the general aesthetic mapping (`aes`
argument). Other examples with additional dataset will illustrate how
each of them can have their own aesthetics.


## Projection and extent (`coord_sf`)

The function `coord_sf` allows to deal with the coordinate system,
which includes both projection and extent of the map. Using the
argument `crs`, it is possible to project on the fly to any projection
defined by a PROJ4 string (here, the world Bonne projection):

```{r world-proj}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf() +
    coord_sf(crs = "+proj=bonne +lon_0=0 +lat_1=60 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")
```

By default, the map will use the coordinate system of the first layer
that defines one (i.e. scanned in the order provided), or if none,
fall back on WGS84 (latitude/longitude, the reference system used in
GPS).

The extent of the map can also be set in `coord_sf`, in practice
allowing to "zoom" in the area we are interested in mapping, provided
by limits on the x-axis (`xlim`), and on the y-axis (`ylim`). Note
that the limits are automatically expanded by a fraction to ensure
that data and axes don't overlap; it can also be turned off to exactly
match the limits provided with `expand = FALSE`:

```{r world-zoom}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf() +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-102.15, -74.12), ylim = c(7.65, 33.97), expand = FALSE)
```


## Scale bar and North arrow (`ggsn::scalebar`)

<!-- MB: Can you check and work it out with ggsn? It seems like a much -->
<!-- better alternative than what we previously had, but I can't -->
<!-- figure exactly how to use it on our example (not sure how this -->
<!-- plays out with projection and extent). -->
<!-- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsn/ -->
<!-- https://github.com/oswaldosantos/ggsn -->

Many packages are available to create a scale bar on a map
(e.g. `prettymapr` or `vcd`). The package `legendMap` provides an
easy-to-use function that allows to add simultaneously the north
symbol and a scale bar into the `ggplot` map:

```{r pkg-legendMap}
install_github("3wen/legendMap")
library("legendMap")
```

Five arguments need to be set manually: `lon`, `lat`, `distance_lon`,
`distance_lat`, and `distance_legend`. The location of the scale bar
has to be specified in longitude/latitude in the `lon` and `lat`
arguments. The shaded distance inside the scale bar is controlled by
the `distance_lon` argument.  In our case, 500 km is a good distance
to use.

Additionally, it is possible to change the font size for the legend of
the scale bar (argument `legend_size`, which defaults to 3). The North
arrow behind the "N" north symbol can also be adjusted for its length
(`arrow_length`), its distance to the scale (`arrow_distance`), or the
size the N north symbol itself (`arrow_north_size`, which defaults to
6).

Note that all distances (`distance_lon`, `distance_lat`,
`distance_legend`, `arrow_length`, `arrow_distance`) are set to `"km"`
by default, in `distance_unit`; they can also be set to nautical miles
with "nm", or miles with "mi".

```{r world-scalebar}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf() +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-102.15, -74.12), ylim = c(7.65, 33.97)) +
    scale_bar(lon = -99.66, lat = 8, distance_lon = 500,
        distance_lat = 50, distance_legend = 100, arrow_length = 300,
        arrow_north_size = 10)
```


## Country names and other names (`geom_text` and `annotate`)

The `world` data set already contains country names and the
coordinates of the centroid of each country (among more
information). We can use this information to plot country names, using
`world` as a regular `data.frame` in `ggplot2`. We first check the
country name information:

```{r world-names}
head(world[, c("NAME", "LON", "LAT")])
```

The command `geom_text` can be used to add a layer of text to a
graphic. The command `geom_text` requires the data needed to enter the
country names, which is the same data as the world map. Again, we have
a very flexible control to adjust the text at will on many aspects: 

* The size (argument `size`);
* The alignment, which is centered by default on the coordinates
  provided. The text can be adjusted horizontally or vertically using
  the arguments `hjust` and `vjust`, which can either be a number
  between 0 (right/bottom) and 1 (top/left) or a character ("left",
  "middle", "right", "bottom", "center", "top"). The text can also be
  offset horizontally or vertically with the argument `nudge_x` and
  `nudge_y`;
* The font of the text, for instance its color (argument `color`) or
  the type of font (`fontface`, which was set to `"bold"`);
* The overlap of labels, using the argument `check_overlap`, which
  removes overlapping text. Alternatively, when there is a lot of
  overlapping labels, the package `ggrepel` provides a
  `geom_text_repel` function that moves label around so that they do
  not overlap.

Alternatively, the `annotate` function can be used to add a single
character string at a specific location, as demonstrated here to add
the Gulf of Mexico:

```{r world_countrylabel}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf() +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-102.15, -74.12), ylim = c(7.65, 33.97), expand = FALSE) +
    geom_text(aes(LON, LAT, label = NAME), size = 4, hjust = "left",
        color = "darkblue", fontface = "bold", check_overlap = TRUE) +
    annotate(geom = "text", x = -90, y = 26, label = "Gulf of Mexico", fontface = "italic", color = "grey22", size = 6)
```


## Final world map

Now to make the final touches, the theme of the map can be edited to
make it more appealing. We suggested the use of `theme_bw` for a
standard theme, but there are many other themes that can be selected
from (see for instance `?ggtheme` in `ggplot2`, or the package
`ggthemes` which provide several useful themes). Moreover, specific
theme elements can be tweaked to get to the final outcome:

* Position of the legend: Although not used in this example, the
  argument `legend.position` allow to automatically place the legend
  (with e.g. `"topright"`, `"bottomleft"`, etc.);
* Grid lines on the map: Using `panel.grid.major` (and
  `panel.grid.minor`), grid lines can be drawn with a gray color and
  dashed lines to clearly distinguish country borders from grid lines.
* Map background: The argument `panel.background` can be used to color
  the background, which is the ocean essentially, with a light blue.
* There are many more elements that can be adjusted to a theme, and
  they are all listed in the `ggplot`2 pdf in Helpful Resources.

<!-- MB: Same here: check with ggsn::scalebar -->

```{r world-florida-final}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf(fill = "cornsilk") +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-102.15, -74.12), ylim = c(7.65, 33.97), expand = FALSE) +
    scale_bar(lon = -99.66, lat = 8, distance_lon = 500,
        distance_lat = 50, distance_legend = 100, arrow_length = 300,
        arrow_north_size = 10) +
    geom_text(aes(LON, LAT, label = NAME), size = 4, hjust = "left",
        color = "darkblue", fontface = "bold", check_overlap = TRUE) +
    annotate(geom = "text", x = -90, y = 26, label = "Gulf of Mexico", fontface = "italic", color = "grey22", size = 6) +
    xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") +
    ggtitle ("World map centered on the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea") +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = gray(.5),
        linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightskyblue1"))
```


# Adding additional layers: an example with points and polygons

In the previous section, we presented general concepts with a map with
little information (country borders only). The modular approach of
`ggplot2` allows to successively add additional layers, for instance
study sites or administrative delineations, as will be illustrated in
this section.


## Point data (`geom_point` and `geom_sf`)

We start by defining two study sites, according to their longitude and
latitude, stored in a `data.frame`:

```{r layers_points-sites}
(sites <- data.frame(longitude = c(-80.144005, -80.109), latitude = c(26.479005, 26.830)))
```

The easiest way to add point coordinates is with the general-purpose
function `geom_point`, which works on any X/Y coordinates,
of regular data points (i.e. not geographic). As such, we can adjust
all characteristics of points (e.g. color of the outline and the
filling, shape, size, etc.), for all points, or using grouping from
the data (i.e defining their "aesthetics"). In this example, we add
the two points as diamonds (`shape = 23`), filled in dark red (`fill =
"darkred"`) and of bigger size (`size = 23`):

```{r points-plot}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf() +
    geom_point(data = sites, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), size = 2, shape = 23, fill = "darkred") +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-89.15, -76.12), ylim = c(24.65, 33.97), expand = FALSE)
```

A better, more flexible alternative is to use the power of `sf`:
Converting the data frame to a `sf` object allows to rely on `sf` to
handle on the fly the coordinate system (both projection and extent),
which can be very useful if the two objects (here world map, and
sites) are not in the same projection. To achieve the same result, the
projection (here WGS84) has to be a priori defined in the `sf` object:

```{r points-sf}
(sites <- st_as_sf(sites, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326, agr = "constant"))

ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf() +
    geom_sf(data = sites, size = 2, shape = 23, fill = "darkred") +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-89.15, -76.12), ylim = c(24.65, 33.97), expand = FALSE)
```

Note that in this case, `coord_sf` has to be called after all
`geom_sf` calls, as to supersede any former input.


## State data (`geom_sf`)

It would be informative to add finer administrative information on top
of the previous map, starting with state borders and names. The
package `maps` (which is automatically installed and loaded with
`ggplot2`) provides maps of the USA, with state and county borders,
that can be retrieved and converted as `sf` objects:

```{r layers_states_data}
states <- st_as_sf(map("state", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))
head(states)
```

State names are part of this data, as the `ID` variable. A simple (but
not necessarily optimal) to add state name is to compute the centroid
of each state polygon as the coordinates where to draw their
names. Centroids are computed with the function `st_centroid`, their
coordinates extracted with `st_coordinates`, both from the package
`sf`, and attached to the state object:

```{r layers_states_centroids}
states <- cbind(states, st_coordinates(st_centroid(states)))
```

Note the warning, which basically says that centroid coordinates using
longitude/latitude data (i.e. WGS84) are not correct, which is
perfectly fine for our drawing purposes. State names, which are not
capitalized in the data from `maps`, can be changed to title case
using the function `toTitleCase` from the package `tools`:

```{r layers_states_capitalizing}
library("tools")
states$ID <- toTitleCase(states$ID)
head(states)
```

To continue adding to the map, state data is directly plotted as an
additional `sf` layer using `geom_sf`. In addition, state names will
be added using `geom_text`, declaring coordinates on the X-axis and
Y-axis, as well as the label (from `ID`), and a relatively big font
size.

```{r layers_states_plot}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf() +
    geom_sf(data = sites, size = 2, shape = 23, fill = "darkred") +
    geom_sf(data = states, fill = NA) + 
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-89.15, -76.12), ylim = c(24.65, 33.97), expand = FALSE) +
    geom_text(data = states, aes(X, Y, label = ID), size = 5)
```


## County data (`geom_sf`)

County data are also available from the package `maps`, and can be
retrieved with the same approach as for state data. This time, only
counties from Florida are retained:

```{r layers_county_data}
counties <- st_as_sf(map("county", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))
counties <- subset(counties, grepl("florida", counties$ID))
head(counties)
```

County lines can now be added in a very simple way, using a gray outline:

```{r layers_county_plot}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf() +
    geom_sf(data = sites, size = 2, shape = 23, fill = "darkred") +
    geom_sf(data = counties, fill = NA, color = gray(.5)) +
    geom_sf(data = states, fill = NA) + 
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-89.15, -76.12), ylim = c(24.65, 33.97), expand = FALSE) +
    geom_text(data = states, aes(X, Y, label = ID), size = 5)
```


## Final map

For the final map, the same color theme as before is used, state names
are slightly adjusted (using the argument `nudge_y` to move them
South) and plotted in filled boxes, and titles, subtitles, axis
labels, and a scale bar are added to the map:

<!-- MB: Same here: check with ggsn::scalebar -->

```{r layers_final}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf(fill = "cornsilk") +
    geom_sf(data = sites, size = 2, shape = 23, fill = "darkred") +
    geom_sf(data = counties, fill = NA, color = gray(.5)) +
    geom_sf(data = states, fill = NA) + 
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-89.15, -76.12), ylim = c(24.65, 33.97), expand = FALSE) +
    scale_bar(lon = -88.66, lat =25,distance_lon = 150, distance_lat = 25, distance_legend = 100, dist_unit = "km", arrow_length=75, arrow_distance=150, arrow_north_size =6, orientation= TRUE,legend_size=2) +
    geom_label(data = states, aes(X, Y, label = ID), size = 5, fontface = "bold", nudge_y = -.5) +
    xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") +
    ggtitle ("Observation Sites", subtitle = "(2 sites in Palm Beach County, Florida)") +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = gray(.5),
        linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightskyblue1"))
```

This example fully demonstrates that adding layers on `ggplot2` is
relatively straightforward, as long as the data is properly stored in
an `sf` object. Adding additional layers would simply follow the same
logic, with additional calls to `geom_sf` at the right place in the
`ggplot2` sequence.


# Another exampleâ€¦

In our other maps, we were creating general map with very little landscape information. Some maps will require water or terrain features to enhance the information being represented.


## Data and basic plot

Other instances will require you to retrieve shapefile data on the internet to complete your map. We can batch of our links in the `URLs`, and the rest of the function is a generic code. The code can be used to retrieve multiple spatial data from one source, in our case it is www.fdgl.org.

## Creating Cities

We would like to add the main Florida cities to our map, as opposed to
all the cities in Florida because it might look very cluttered. You
can use this general code for any city in the United States. You could
change the region to the state name, which is lowercase. The function
`geocode` requires the package `ggmap` to work:

```{r featmap_cities}
library("ggmap")

city_names <- c("Miami", "Fort Lauderdale", "Orlando", "Gainesville", "Tallahassee", "Tampa", "Jacksonville")
city_locs <- cbind(city_names, geocode(city_names))

cities <- st_as_sf(city_locs, coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326, agr = "constant")
(cities <- cbind(cities, st_coordinates(cities)))
```


## Final Map

The final map will include very familiar themes and features.

```{r featmap_final}
ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf(fill = "cornsilk") +
    geom_sf(data = states, fill = NA) +
    geom_sf(data = flma_jun17, fill = "darkgreen", color = NA, alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_sf(data = mjrivp, color = "dodgerblue", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_sf(data = sfwmd_canals_dec08, color = "dodgerblue", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_sf(data = cities, size = 3, shape = 23, fill = "darkred") +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-87.35, -79.50), ylim = c(24.10, 30.80)) +
    scale_bar(lon = -87.00, lat =24.50,distance_lon = 100, distance_lat = 15, distance_legend = 50, dist_unit = "km", arrow_length=50, arrow_distance=65, arrow_north_size =5, orientation= TRUE,legend_size=2.5) +
    geom_label(data = cities, aes(X, Y, label = city_names), size = 3, fontface = "bold", nudge_x = .2, nudge_y = .2) +
    annotate(geom = "text", x = -85.5, y = 27.5, label = "Gulf of Mexico", fontface = "italic", color = "grey22", size = 5) +
    xlab("Longitude")+ ylab("Latitude") +
    ggtitle ("Florida Natural Resources Map", subtitle = "(rivers, canals, and managed areas)") +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = gray(.5),
        linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightskyblue1"))
```


## Saving with ggsave

The final map now ready, it would be a good idea to save it. Using
`ggsave` will allow a graphic to be saved in a variety of formats,
including the most common PNG (raster bitmap) and PDF (vector
graphics):

```{r featmap_ggsave, eval = FALSE}
ggsave("Floridamap.png")
ggsave("Floridamap.pdf")
```


# Print Feature

You can use the `print` function to place multiple maps in one map graphic. This can be a useful and easy way to enhance the information you need to display.  


```{r printmap_mapsdata, include=TRUE}


rmarkplot<-
  ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf(fill = "antiquewhite1") +
    geom_sf(data = flparksandrec2, fill = "darkgreen", colour = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_sf(data = flmjwater2, fill = "deepskyblue", colour = "deepskyblue", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_sf(data = st, fill = NA, colour = "black") + 
    geom_text(aes(x=lon, y=lat, label = City), data = flcities, size = 3.9, inherit.aes = TRUE, nudge_y =.18, col = "black", check_overlap = TRUE,fontface = "bold") +
    annotate(geom="text", x=-85.50, y=27.50, label= "Gulf of Mexico", color="grey22",size=4.5) +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(-87.35, -79.5), ylim = c(24.1, 30.8), expand = TRUE) +
    xlab("Longitude")+ ylab("Latitude") +
    theme_classic() + 
    theme(legend.position = "none", panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = gray(.5), linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5),panel.background = element_rect(fill = "aliceblue"), panel.border=element_rect(fill=NA))

rmarkplot2<-  
   ggplot(data=world)+
  geom_sf(fill = "antiquewhite1") +
    geom_sf(data = flparksandrec2, fill = "darkgreen", colour = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_sf(data = flmjwater2, fill = "deepskyblue", colour = "deepskyblue", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_sf(data = st, fill = NA, colour = "black") + 
    geom_text(aes(x=lon, y=lat, label = City), data = flcities, size = 3.9, inherit.aes = TRUE, nudge_y =.18, col = "black", check_overlap = TRUE,fontface = "bold") +
    annotate(geom="text", x=-85.50, y=27.50, label= "Gulf of Mexico", color="grey22",size=4.5) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-80.30, -80.00 ), ylim = c(26.63, 26.9), expand=TRUE ) +
    ggtitle ("Location A") + 
  xlab("Longitude")+ ylab("Latitude") +
  theme_map() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = gray(.5), linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5),panel.background = element_rect(fill = "aliceblue"), panel.border=element_rect(fill=NA),text=element_text(size=6))

rmarkplot3<- 
  ggplot(data=world)+
  geom_sf(fill="antiquewhite1") +
  geom_sf(data = flparksandrec2, fill = "darkgreen", colour = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_sf(data = flmjwater2, fill = "deepskyblue", colour = "deepskyblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_sf(data = st, fill = NA, colour = "black") + 
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-80.30, -80.00 ), ylim = c(26.62, 26.35), expand=TRUE ) + 
  ggtitle ("Location B") + 
  xlab("Longitude")+ ylab("Latitude") +
  theme_map() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = gray(.5), linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5),panel.background = element_rect(fill = "aliceblue"), panel.border=element_rect(fill=NA),text=element_text(size=6))
  
  

```


To use the `print` function you would need to first make view port that specify the max width and height of each map, and the minimum x and y coordinates where it map can be located. The `just=` will make a position on how the secondary maps will be displayed. I wanted the secondary maps to be displayed on the bottom left of the frame, so that will create a guide on where they will first appear. 

```{r printmap_vp}
vp <- viewport(width = 0.37, height = 0.32, x = 0.22, y =0.45, just = c("left","bottom")) 
vp1<- viewport(width = 0.37, height = 0.32, x = 0.22, y =0.15, just = c("left","bottom")) 
```

When the maps are completed, and the `viewport`s are specified, you can now print the secondary maps on top of your main map. This will take some tweaking, since it's not measured in coordinates but rather with R Studios own measurements.

```{r printmap_finalmap}

print(rmarkplot)
print(rmarkplot2, vp=vp)
print(rmarkplot3, vp=vp1)


```


You can also decide to save this printed map by running all the code at once. It will save it in the format you prefer. We used it as a png. but pdf. is also available. 

```{r printmap_saving, eval=FALSE}
png("PrintMapping.png",width = 7, height = 7, units = "in", res = 300)
print(rmarkplot)
print(rmarkplot2, vp=vp)
print(rmarkplot3, vp=vp1)
dev.off()
```


# Multiple Maps in one window

## Introduction

Having a way to emphasize locations on a map can also be a graphic that would be useful for biologists. The next steps will be to create blank square plots that will make your map visualization interesting and accurate. In our map, we will zooming into two different locations in Florida, for a close up of the area using the map we previously built. 

First, we will start with the overall packages needed to build this 

Credit to Ilya Kashnitsky (https://ikashnitsky.github.io/2017/align-six-maps/).


```{r listplot_packages, eval=FALSE}
library(sp)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(ggthemes)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
library(lattice)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Map Placement Function 
The function below will allow us to grab plots that we have previously made, with `ggplotGrob` , and create arrows pointing to the maps. 
 
First, we need to list our plots, normally in the order you would like them to appear. We also need to specify where in the frame of window they will be. This can be tinkered with to move your maps to exactly where you need them. We also defined our arrow location and then later drew them out in our map.


```{r listplots_function}

list.plots=list(rmarkplot,rmarkplot2, rmarkplot3)
align_three_plots <- function(list.plots, family = "")
  {
  
gg <- ggplot()+
 
  coord_equal(xlim = c(0, 80), ylim = c(0, 51), expand=TRUE) +
  annotation_custom(ggplotGrob(rmarkplot), xmin = 0.0, xmax =57, ymin = 0.0, ymax = 50) +
  annotation_custom(ggplotGrob(rmarkplot2),xmin = 58, xmax = 80, ymin = 25, ymax = 51) +
  annotation_custom(ggplotGrob(rmarkplot3), xmin = 58, xmax = 80, ymin = 0.0, ymax = 29) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_void()

df.arrows <- data.frame(id=1:2,
                        x=c(45.6,45.4),
                        y=c(21.7,19.8),
                        xend=c(58,58),
                        yend=c(35,12))


gg <- gg +
  geom_segment(data = df.arrows %>% filter(id==1),
             aes(x=x,y=y,xend=xend,yend=yend),
             arrow = arrow(type="closed",length = unit(0.25,"cm"))) +
  geom_segment(data = df.arrows %>% filter(id==2),
             aes(x=x,y=y,xend=xend,yend=yend),
             arrow = arrow(type="closed",length = unit(0.25,"cm")))
}

```


## Creating a Simple Empty Square Plot

The next code will allow up to make a simple empty square plot, that can be cloned so we can place our maps inside. 

```{r listplot_blankplot}

library("ggthemes")

p <- 
  ggplot()+
  theme_map() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", size = 0.5, fill = NA),aspect.ratio = 1)

```

## Cloning and Final Map 
We will now close our map three times, since we are using three maps. We specified a larger Florida map with two zoomed in maps showing us Florida rivers. 

```{r alignplots}

library("tidyverse")

plots <- mget(rep("p", 3))

three<- align_three_plots(plots)

plot(three)
```

## Maps with legend inbetween

Sometimes you will need a legend to help you display information. We are using very similar code as before, but with a `LegendMap` we are creating a map with the necessary legend information. 

```{r legendmap}

LegendMap<-
  ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=REGION)) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option="plasma", discrete=TRUE)

Map1<- 
  ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=REGION)) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-10.00, 40.00), ylim = c(20.00, 50.00), expand=TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option="plasma", discrete=TRUE) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(show=FALSE)) +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.position= "none", panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "azure", linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5), panel.background = element_rect(fill = "azure"), panel.border=element_rect(fill=NA),plot.title = element_text(size=16, face="bold"))

Map2<-
  ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=REGION)) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-100.00,-60.00 ), ylim = c(20.00, 50.00), expand=TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option="plasma", discrete=TRUE) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(show=FALSE)) +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.position= "none", panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "azure", linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5), panel.background = element_rect(fill = "azure"), panel.border=element_rect(fill=NA),plot.title = element_text(size=16, face="bold"))


  

```

Now we are grabbing the legend from `LegendMap` and plotting it inside the same window, the `x11` is the size of the window we want, the `NUL`L in the `plot_grid` is to make an empty space where we can later draw the legend with `draw_grob`/


```{r gettinglegend}

legend <- get_legend(LegendMap+ theme(legend.position="left") )


prow <- plot_grid( Map1 + theme(legend.position="none"), 
                   NULL, Map2 + theme(legend.position="none"),
                   align = 'vh',
                   #labels = c("A","", "B" ),
                   hjust = -1,
                   nrow = 1,
                   rel_widths = c(.35, .50, .35)
)

prow + draw_grob(legend, 2/4,1/20, 0.003) 


```
