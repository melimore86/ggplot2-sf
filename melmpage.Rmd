Mel Moreno began her six-week internship in Mathieu Basille's lab in May 2017. As a Miami native, she was familiar with Davie, and thrilled to return to South Florida for the summer. Mel Moreno was an ideal candidate for this internship, because of her interest with R, and spatial ecology. Mel had taken Quantitative Ecology (WIS 4601) in Fall 2016, and realized she had a real knack for R data analysis.
